                Bitcoin (â‚¿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.<br>
                Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain.<br>
                The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.<br>
                The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software.
